/**
 * GPT Image 2 via fal.ai (plan §H.9: "Fal also hosts GPT Image 2 — a
 * single-transport variant exists if OpenRouter disappoints").
 *
 * That contingency became the primary. fal is the transport we can reliably
 * top up, and running both image models through one vendor collapses a whole
 * class of operational surface: one balance, one queue protocol, one
 * cancellation story, one retention conversation. OpenRouter stays as the text
 * transport (the Claude interpreter, the Kimi treatment stage) and as the
 * image fallback — which is exactly what the adapter boundary was for: this is
 * a config change, not a redesign.
 *
 * Endpoint and input contract verified 2026-07-30 against fal's published
 * OpenAPI schema for `openai/gpt-image-2`, not from a docs page: `image_size`
 * accepts an explicit `{width, height}` (multiples of 16, max edge 3840, ratio
 * ≤ 3:1, 655,360–8,294,400 pixels), `quality` is auto|low|medium|high, and the
 * response is the same `images[]` shape the identity engine returns.

/**
 * THE MASKED-EDIT ENGINE — GPT Image 2, at the master's exact resolution.
 *
 * Two things this fixes, and the first one cost the founder three refusals on
 * the first three minutes of real use.
 *
 * **The output size is PINNED, not hoped for.** The incumbent identity engine
 * takes a resolution TIER ("1K"), and Nano Banana Pro answered a 1024x1536
 * master with 848x1264 — its own cap at roughly a megapixel, at the right aspect
 * and the wrong size. A masked composite cannot use that: the master is never
 * resampled, so a patch of a different shape has nothing to composite against.
 * `image_size` takes exact pixels, so the engine is told the answer rather than
 * asked for a size class.
 *
 * **And it is GPT Image 2**, which is the routing row the face wall established:
 * the founder's eye, the seat's eye and the convergence arithmetic picked it
 * independently for face-region edits, and every render on the wall came from
 * it. The product path was still calling the incumbent, so the wall was
 * measuring one engine while production ran another — the gap this closes.
