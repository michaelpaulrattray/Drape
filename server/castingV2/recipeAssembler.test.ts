/**
 * THE DEGENERATE CASE FIRST, AND THEN EVERY REFUSAL DRIVEN DIRECTLY.
 *
 * fable-171's condition 1 on the compositor swap: *the degenerate case gets its
 * own fixture proof first* — a no-library cast with a words-only ask is the road
 * every NEW cast travels, so it is the most-travelled road, not the edge case.
 * It is the first test in this file for that reason.
 *
 * The refusals are driven straight at `assembleRecipe`, never through a model
 * that usually behaves (working law 3). A guard whose only test runs through an
 * LLM is an untested guard.
